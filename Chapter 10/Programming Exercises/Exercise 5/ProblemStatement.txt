Modify the Student class from the chapter by adding a mutator method that records
a grade for the student. Here is the specification of the new method:

addGrade(self, gradePoint, credits) gradePoint is a float that represents a grade
	(e.g., A = 4.0, A- = 3.7, B+ = 3.3, etc.), and credits is a float
	indicating the number of credit hours for the class. Modifies the student
	object by adding this grade information.

Use the updated class to implement a simple program for calculating GPA. Your 
program should create a new student object that has 0 credits and 0 quality points
(the name is irrelevant). Your program should then prompt the user to enter course
information (gradepoint and credits) and then print out the final GPA achieved.
