Implement a class to represent a playing card. Your class should have the following methods:

__init__(self, rank, suit):
	"rank" is an int in the range 1-13 indicating the ranks Ace-King
	"suit" is a single character "d", "c", "h", or "s" indicating the suit (diamonds, clubs, hearts, or spades)
	Create the corresponding card.

getRank(self):
	Returns the rank of the card.

getSuit(self):
	Returns the suit of the card.

BJValue(self):
	Returns the Blackjack value of a card. Ace counts as 1, face cards count as 10.

__str__(self):
	Returns a string that names the card. For example, "Ace of Spades".

Note: A method named __str__ is special in Python. If asked to convert an object into a string, Python uses this method, if it's present. For example

	c = Card(1,"s")
	print c

will print "Ace of Spades".

Test your card class with a program that prints out n randomly generated cards and the associated Blackjack value where n is a number supplied by the user.
