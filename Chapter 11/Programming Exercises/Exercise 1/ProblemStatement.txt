Modify the statistics package from the chapter so that client programs have
more flexibility in computing the mean and/or standard deviation. Specif-
ically, redesign the library to have the following functions:

mean(nums) Returns the mean of numbers in nums.
stdDev(nums) Returns the standard deviation of nums.
meanStdDev(nums) Returns both the mean and standard deviation of nums.
