Most languages do not have the flexible built-in list (array) operations
that Python has. Write an algorithm for each of the following Python
operations and test your algorithm by writing it up in a suitable function.
For example, as a function, reverse(myList) should do the same as 
myList.reverse(). Obviously, you are not allowed to use the corresponding
Python method to implement your function.

(a) count(myList, x) : like myList.count(x)
(b) isin(myList, x) : like x in myList
(c) index(myList, x) : like myList.index(x)
(d) reverse(myList) : like myList.reverse()
(e) sort(myList) : like myList.sort()
