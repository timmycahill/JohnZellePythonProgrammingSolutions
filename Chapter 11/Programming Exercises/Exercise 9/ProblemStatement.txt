One disadvantage of passing a function to the list sort method is that it makes the sorting slower, since this function is called repeatedly as Python needs to compare various items.
An alternative to creating a special key functino is to create a "decorated" list that will sort in the desired order using the standard Python ordering. For example, to sort Student objects by GPA, we could first create a list of tuples [(gpa0, Student0), (gpa1, Student1), ..] and then sort this list without passing a key function. These tuples will get sorted into GPA order. The resulting list can then be traversed to rebuild a list of student objects in GPA order. Redo the gpasort program using this approach.
