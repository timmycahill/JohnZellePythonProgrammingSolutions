Royal Flush: 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, all of the same suit.
Straight Flush: 5 ranks in a row, all of the same suit.
Four of a Kind: Four of the same rank.
Full House: Three of one rank and two of another.

Straight: Five ranks in a row.
Three of a kind: Three of one rank (but not a full house or four of a kind).
Two pair: Two each of two different ranks.
Pair: Two of the same rank (but not two pair, three or four of a kind).
X High: If none of the previous categories fit, X is the value of the highest rank. 	For example, if the largest rank is 11, the hand is "Jack high."
